Git is structured in *Repositories*.

The repositories on Github are divided in two types of repositories:

-   Those you have writing access to (your repositories)

-   Repositories belonging to people that you can only view

> Challenge: Log into your github account.

Log into your Github account.

1.  Find the place where your repositories (will) live.

<!-- -->

2.  Search for other people's repositories.

While you don't have writing access to most repositories, they provide a great resource.

> Challenge: Use Github as a resource. Type "Open Science" into the search bar.

The search reveals all repositories that have the word "Open Science"; in them. In addition to Issues, Discussions, Usernames etc. with that term.

Other information that are revealed about the repositories are information such as the programming languages used (here: Python) and the number of *stars* the repositories has and the date the repository was last updated. You can star repositories that you like; they will appear in your profile under *your stars*.

> Challenge: Click on one of the repositories and have a look at the content!
