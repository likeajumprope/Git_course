## Creating a new repository

You have two options when creating a new repository.

-   Click on the + next to your profile image in the top right corner of the screen

-   Go to the repositories tab within your profile page and click the *New* button.

1.  Choose one of the ways just described to initialize a new repository.

2.  Name your repository - keep it short and precise, for example "My_first_repo" ( you might realize that Github will also make some more or less reasonable suggestions).
3.  Describe it (optional).
4.  Select *Public/Private*. If you have a free account, all your repositories will be public.
5.  Check the box to initialize your repository with a "Readme.md"
6.  Click *Create repository*

## Congratulations! You have created your first repository!
