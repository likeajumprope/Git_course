This workshop is to introduce you to GitHub and show how it can be used for collaborative projects, such as book sprints and sharing training materials.

Here's what you can expect to be doing over the next two hours:

-   Creating, cloning, forking repositories

-   Working in branches to compare different versions of files

-   Working on the Github platform and with the Github Desktop Client

-   Good collaborative (reproducible) practices



# Code of Conduct

# Essential setup

For this workshop you will need:

-   An account on [Github.com](https://github.com). I recommend making it secure using 2-factor authentication.
